This mod adds extra string to the games, so combat feedback can be more detailed.
Damage types are reported, plus bonus and resisted damage, just like in IWD2.

Installation
============

Check where you installed GemRB (data) and mark it down.

Run WeiDU as (substituting with the real path; USE THE CORRECT dir for your GAME):

   weidu --search /path/to/gemrbs/datadir/unhardcoded/bg2/ better-combat-feedback/setup-bcf.tp2
