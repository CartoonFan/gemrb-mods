Only the english strings are currently supported, but that's easily changed below.

====== Installation ======
Check where you installed GemRB (data) too and copy these files from unhardcoded/bg2:
  - avprefc.2da
  - classes.2da
  - clskills.2da
  - fistweap.2da
  - qslots.2da
  - skills.2da
Where? Copy them to the "data" dir in the game dir.

Run WeiDU in the game directory, eg.:
<code>
WeiDU setup-sorcerer-monk.tp2

TODO: in the end, package weidu, so setup-sorcerer-monk.exe can be used

Rerun weidu and choose uninstall.
