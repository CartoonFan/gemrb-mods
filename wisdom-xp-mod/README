This mod gives everyone a bonus or malus to the experience gained depending on their wisdom (a feature only known in PST). 

For example, choosing the 2% table means that a character with 5 wisdom will receive 10% less xp,
while a sage with 18 will receive 16% more.

NOTE: the displayed string for xp gained will not change, since it is party based (same for quest xp).

Installation
============

Check where you installed GemRB (data) and mark it down.

Run WeiDU as (substituting with the real path; USE THE CORRECT dir for your GAME):

   weidu --search /path/to/gemrbs/datadir/unhardcoded/bg2/ wisdom-xp-mod/setup-wisbon.tp2

If you want a different modifier table, manually edit override/wisxpbon.2da and then send it over for inclusion in the mod
