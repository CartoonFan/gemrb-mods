The cabin lies just west of the village and I may use it as much or as little as I wish.~

She says the humans will not listen to her  and I have agreed to go and do what I can to help.~

He only has half of his ancestor's journal, and finding the other half might be my only clue to locating the cache.  Likely the other half is also in the area, perhaps in the old dungeon, itself.~
