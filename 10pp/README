Maximum party size extender
===========================
This Weidu/perl mod will extend scripts to also refer to player objects beyond
player 6. It can start anywhere, BUT IS ONLY USABLE with GemRB, since the
other engines do not support more objects.

PERL IS REQUIRED and not bundled at this point. If you're on windows, look at
https://www.perl.org/get.html (ActiveState or Strawberry)

Check the screenshots folder for some action shots.

Mods known not to cause problems (let me know!):
* NPC: Haldamir, Tashia, Saradas2, Kivan
* Misc: Dungeon be gone

Installation
------------
This mod should be installed after all other script&dialog altering/adding mods!
For bg2, the G3 Fixpack is required (Core fixes): www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/

Since it also extends embedded dialog scripts, it is best to just install it last.

The conversion process can take several minutes depending on the size of your install!
Please be patient and DO NOT INTERRUPT execution lest you want to start from zero.
There is only one query and then you can go plant some coffee.

Clone the gemrb-mods repository to you computer and copy 10pp to the game dir.

Run WeiDU in the game directory, eg.:

    WeiDU 10pp/setup-10pp.tp2

If it breaks, remove the backup directory and add the offending file to the
exception list in extend.pl. Rerun.

If you are a modder, you can check the files in the diffs/ directory, which
will contain all the differences for the changed files.

Exceptions
----------
Some funky scripts are not handled. Presently this includes fguard.baf from
bg2 (extra globals setting), but that file is not that important, so we don't
ship manual overrides either.

Some difficulty scripts that check for party size are not scalable. Eg. the
final hell fight does not spawn any extra demons for larger parties.

Similar caveats hold for dialogs, just more often. From vanilla bg2, this
includes the drow pit fights and challenging for the druid grove. If there
are any problems with mod added stuff, let me know.

For mod authors
---------------
TODO: figure out if they can pre-extend their scripts without the other engines
breaking apart.

Development
-----------
If you'll be extending the extender logic, use test-suite.pl and write tests
under tests/* liberally. All other paths lead to madness and peril.

To add tests, just add a file and then make a copy with the desired changes,
naming it file_expected. Dialog tests need a D after their id.

Example invocations:
  * ./test-suite.pl       # runs all tests, prints diffs for failures
  * ./test-suite.pl -q    # runs all tests without printing diffs for failures
  * ./test-suite.pl "someglob"   # runs specified tests

cdiff.pl is a perl version of diff used by wrapper.pl for portability. The
wrapper is the main entry point for external use. The parameters are input baf,
max party size and an optional output baf. Without it just the diff will be
generated for changed files. Example:

    ./wrapper.pl rerak06.baf 8

... would extend rerak06.baf for up to 8 PCs, save the diff under
diffs/rerak06.baf.diff and delete the temporary file.
NOTE: do not use the same input and output file!
