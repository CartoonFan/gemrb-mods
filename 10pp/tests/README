These tests were prepared to be checked against a party cap of 8.
Evaluation happens with the provided ../test-suite.pl script, which
extends testX and compares it to testX_expected. If they're not the same,
something is broken!

tests for PlayerX:
1: noop
2: triggers, negated triggers, OR counts (no body)
3: whole blocks (mentions in body)
4: body append
5: whole blocks (mentions in both)
6: body append (multiple response blocks)
7: body append (separate response blocks)
8: body append + whole blocks + variables grrrr (bg2/fguard.baf, bg2/borinall.baf)
9: triggers (single player action) + accidental positives ("DeadPlayer6" global)

11: triggers (multiple OR blocks)
12: triggers (OR block with extra actions)
13: triggers (OR block with extra player actions)
14: triggers (multiple OR + OR block with extra actions)
15: triggers (multiple OR + OR block with extra player actions)
16: triggers (multiple OR x extra player actions + extra action)
17: triggers (whole block)
18: triggers (whole block + OR)
19: triggers (whole block + multiple mentions)
20: whole block (multiple mentions in body)
21: body append (multiple mentions in same block)
22: body append (multiple mentions in same block + multiple RB)
23: body append (multiple mentions in same block + separate RB)
24: body append (single&multiple mentions in same block + separate RB)
25: whole blocks + accidental positives ("DeadPlayer6" global)
26: whole block (new trigger block + body append)
27: whole block (append triggers + append actions)
28: whole block (append triggers + new response blocks)
29: whole block (append triggers + new separate response blocks)
30: body append (separate reponse blocks + not last)
31: skippable exception
32: NumInParty*(6) hack
33: dialog (trivial action append)
34: dialog (action append with line noise: before)
35: dialog (action append with line noise: after)
36: dialog (action append with line noise: both)
37: dialog (action append with line noise: both) + TOKEN?
38: dialog (trivial trigger append)
39: dialog (OR in a late transition)
40: dialog (simpler version of 33, OR)

uddrow16.d: requires manual intervention

TODO:
NumInParty*(6) is only used in 3 scripts in bg2:
 - borinall.baf and ar2906.baf: fine with the NumInParty*GT(5) hack
 - rerak06.baf: somewhat close, but fine even without it

10: NumInParty exception? (borinall.baf): 
	if parameter is divided by count of PlayerX objects and all are in separate
	response blocks, leave alone, copy whole, append new objects and extend original param to 8?


TODO: how/ilgem6.baf (why oh why didn't they use [PC])
