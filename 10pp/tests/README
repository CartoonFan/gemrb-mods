WIP: test suite in progress!

run it with a party cap of 8 and it will change testX and compare it
to testX_expected. If they're not the same, something is broken!

tests for PlayerX:
1: noop
2: triggers, negated triggers, OR counts (no body)
3: whole blocks (mentions in body)
4: body append
5: whole blocks (mentions in both)
6: body append (multiple response blocks)
7: body append (separate response blocks)
8: body append + variables grrrr (bg2/fguard.baf, bg2/borinall.baf)
9: accidental positives + bad decompile ("DeadPlayer6" global, "layer6")
	FIXME: probably should correct the syntax, I doubt weidu is robust enough

TODO:
10: NumInParty exception? (borinall.baf): 
	if parameter is divided by count of PlayerX objects and all are in separate
	response blocks, leave alone, copy whole, append new objects and extend original param to 8?


TODO: repeat for PlayerXFill (autogenerate? bg2/cut37a.baf is the only vanilla user)
TODO: how/ilgem6.baf (why oh why didn't they use [PC])
