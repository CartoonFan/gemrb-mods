- rewrite in a more deterministic manner
- figure out what to do with any exceptions
  - and extend the tests to cover them

- once working, plug into weidu: see setup-10pp.tp2
  - debug weidu script, mostly for syntax errors
  - test suite should still be runnable
  - write instructions (install last, exceptions)
  - consider converting to weidu completely, since perl is not there for winfolk
    - someone could compile the perl script with a wrapper also in perl
