- rewrite in a more deterministic manner
- figure out what to do with any exceptions
  - and extend the tests to cover them

- once working, plug into weidu: see setup-10pp.tp2
  - add decompiling and recompiling of scripts
  - store a diff in the mod dir for debugging purposes
  - test suite should still be runnable
  - write instructions (install last, exceptions)
  - consider converting to weidu completely, since perl is not there for winfolk
