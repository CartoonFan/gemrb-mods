This mods gives everyone a bonus or malus to the experience gained depending on their wisdom (a feature only known in PST).

Installation
============

1. add HasWisdomBonusTable = 1 to the gemrb.ini in the gemrb unhardcoded path (eg. gemrb/unhardcoded/bg2/gemrb.ini) or copy that file to the game override and change the value there.

2. add a override/wisxpbon.2da with the wanted modifiers (in absolute percent).

There is an example wisxpbon.2da included in this directory, with a cummulative 2% bonus/malus for offsets from wisdom of 10.
