gemrb-mods
==========

Repository of my GemRB mods and tools not included with GemRB itself. Available under GPLv2, see COPYING for details.

Some come in form of shell scripts, but could easily be adapted to work elsewhere.

Prerequisites
=============
* WeiDU - http://weidu.org

Runtime:
* GemRB - http://gemrb.org
* Any of the Infinity Engine games

**Copy each mod you want to your game dir individually!** Weidu doesn't handle nesting well.

TODO
====
* create a common format regardless of the payload
* docs, wiki crossover
