gemrb-mods
==========

Repository of my GemRB mods and tools not included with GemRB itself.

Many come in form of shell scripts, but could easily be adapted to work elsewhere.

Prerequisites
=============
* Python
* WeiDU - http://weidu.org

Runtime:
* GemRB - http://gemrb.org
* Any of the Infinity Engine games


TODO
====
* figure out a better way to insert string references / enhance WeiDU
* port the scripted hacks to python
* make them runnable from anywhere, completely path agnostic&safe
* figure out a better backup mechanism, prefferably just using WeiDU's existing one
* (external) fix GemRB's overriding priority to simplify mod installation, not pollute the engine files and enable their modding
* double check that WeiDU can work from anywhere
* docs, wiki crossover
