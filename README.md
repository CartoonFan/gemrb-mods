gemrb-mods
==========

Repository of GemRB mods and tools not included with GemRB itself. Available under GPLv2, see COPYING for details.

Some simple mods require only setting tweaks. For those, check this list on the main website:
http://www.gemrb.org/wiki/doku.php?id=developers:mods

Prerequisites
=============
* WeiDU - http://weidu.org

Runtime:
* GemRB - http://gemrb.org
* Any of the Infinity Engine games

**Copy each mod you want to your game dir individually!** Weidu doesn't handle nesting well.

TODO
====
* create a multicomponent gemrb-tweakpack for all the trivial tweaks and toggles
* consider traifying the remaining mods
