gemrb-mods
==========

Repository of my GemRB mods and tools not included with GemRB itself. Available under GPLv2, see COPYING for details.

Some come in form of shell scripts, but could easily be adapted to work elsewhere.

DISCLAIMER: early versions of mods. While they do work for me, they contain a lot of assumptions! The platform is not ready yet for better generalisation, as noted below in the TODO.

Prerequisites
=============
* Python
* WeiDU - http://weidu.org

Runtime:
* GemRB - http://gemrb.org
* Any of the Infinity Engine games

**Copy each mod you want to your game dir individually!** Weidu doesn't handle nesting well.

TODO
====
* port the scripted hacks to weidu
* create a common format regardless of the payload
* figure out a better backup mechanism if complete WeiDUfication is not possible
* docs, wiki crossover
