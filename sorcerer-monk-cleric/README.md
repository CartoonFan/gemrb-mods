What does this mod do?
======================

This mods adds a new multiclass choice, sorcerer/monk/cleric. Currently dualclassing is **not** possible (see notes in the tp2 file).

Mage race and item restrictions, monk avatar, combined starting gear in tob, no detecting traps or turn undead (custom actionbar).

Only the english strings are currently supported, but that's easily changed - just provide me a standard TRA file.

Installation
------------
Check where you installed GemRB (data) too and copy these files from unhardcoded/bg2:
  - avprefc.2da
  - classes.2da
  - clskills.2da
  - fistweap.2da
  - qslots.2da
  - skills.2da
Where? Copy them to the "override" dir in the game dir.

Run WeiDU in the game directory, eg.:

    WeiDU setup-sorcerer-monk-cleric.tp2

TODO: in the end, package weidu, so setup-sorcerer-monk.exe can be used

Uninstallation
--------------
Rerun weidu and choose uninstall.
