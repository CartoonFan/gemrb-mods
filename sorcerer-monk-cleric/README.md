What does this mod do?
======================

This mods adds a new multiclass choice, sorcerer/monk/cleric. Currently dualclassing is **not** possible (see notes in the tp2 file).

Mage race and item restrictions, monk avatar, combined starting gear in tob, no detecting traps or turn undead (custom actionbar).

Only the english strings are currently supported, but that's easily changed - just provide me a standard TRA file.
